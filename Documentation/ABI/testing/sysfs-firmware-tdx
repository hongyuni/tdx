Description:
                Intel's Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) protect guest VMs from
                malicious hosts and some physical attacks.  This directory
                represents the entry point directory for the TDX.

                the TDX requires the TDX firmware to load into an isolated
                memory region.  It requires a two-step loading process.  It uses
                the first phase firmware loader (a.k.a NP-SEAMLDR) that loads
                the next loader and the second phase firmware loader(a.k.a
                P-SEAMLDR) that loads the TDX firmware(a.k.a the "TDX module").

Description:
                The P-SEAMLDR is the TDX module loader. The P-SEAMLDR comes
                with its attributes, vendor_id, build_date, build_num, minor
                version, major version to identify itself.

                Provides the information about the P-SEAMLDR loaded on the
                platform.  This directory exists if the P-SEAMLDR is
                successfully loaded.  It contains the following read-only files.
                The information corresponds to the data structure, SEAMLDR_INFO.
                The admins or VMM management software like libvirt can refer to
                that information, determine if P-SEAMLDR is supported, and
                identify the loaded P-SEAMLDR.
